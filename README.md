Plagiarism Checker in Python



# Plagiarism Checker

This is a simple plagiarism checker application built in Python using the tkinter library for the user interface and the difflib library to calculate text similarity.

## Description

This plagiarism checker allows you to input a text and a reference text and checks for plagiarism by calculating the similarity between the two texts using the SequenceMatcher class from the difflib library. If the similarity between the two texts is greater than or equal to 0.8, the application will detect plagiarism and display the similarity score.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/plagiarism-checker.git
   cd plagiarism-checker
   ```

2. Run the Python script `plagiarism_checker.py` to launch the application:

   ```shell
   python plagiarism_checker.py
   ```

3. Enter your text in the "Enter your text here..." input field and the reference text in the "Enter the reference text here..." input field.

4. Click the "Check Plagiarism" button to calculate the similarity and check for plagiarism.

5. The result will be displayed in the "Plagiarism result will be displayed here..." text field.
